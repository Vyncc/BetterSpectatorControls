# Better Spectator Controls

CynderBlock's Specator Controls bakkesmod plugin with a command added to flycam + focus player.

This is a fork from CynderBlock's Specator Controls bakkesmod plugin.

I added a command `SpectateSetCameraFlyFocusPlayer <loc X> <loc Y> <loc Z> <rot X (in degrees)> <rot y> <rot z> <FOV> <team (blue or orange)> <player number (in alphabetical order, starts at 0)>`
